# Mouse Tumor Volume Analysis

**Overview**

This data analysis project explores the relationship between tumor volume in mice and various drug regimens. The goal is to gain insights into the effectiveness of different treatments in inhibiting tumor growth and to understand potential correlations between tumor volume and mouse characteristics.

**Data Source**

The data used in this analysis was obtained from two CSV files: "mouse_metadata.csv" containing mouse metadata, and "study_results.csv" containing study results.

**Data Cleaning and Merging**

The first step of the analysis involved cleaning the data and handling any missing or duplicate entries. The two datasets were then merged into a comprehensive dataset for further analysis.

**Key Findings**
* Summary statistics: Calculated mean, median, variance, standard deviation, and standard error of the mean for each drug regimen to assess treatment efficacy.
* Timepoint distribution: Visualized the total number of timepoints for all mice tested per drug regimen using bar plots.
* Gender distribution: Created pie charts to display the distribution of female vs. male mice in the study.
* Outlier detection: Identified potential outliers in the final tumor volume data for four treatment regimens (Capomulin, Ramicane, Infubinol, and Ceftamin) using box plots.
* Correlation and Regression: Explored the relationship between mouse weight and average tumor volume for the Capomulin regimen using correlation analysis and linear regression.

**Impact**

This analysis provides valuable insights into the effectiveness of specific drug regimens in inhibiting tumor growth in mice. The correlations discovered between tumor volume and mouse characteristics offer potential avenues for further research and personalized treatment approaches.

**Conclusion**
The project showcases strong data analysis skills, including data cleaning, visualization, and statistical analysis. The findings contribute to the understanding of tumor growth dynamics and the evaluation of drug treatment outcomes.
